# interpolate-session-javascript
 
When a user talks to a chatbot, it may leave some interesting data such as name, age, place of birth or favorite color. Here we make the user leave the name information when talking to a chatbot. Firstname, an object representing the state of the chat conversation, was stored in **session**. This bot uses session variables stored in its messages and uses these session variables in the conversation.
